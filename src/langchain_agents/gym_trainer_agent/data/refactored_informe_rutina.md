# Creating and Programming Routines

## Introduction
The main objective is to provide evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for designing personalized and effective training routines for strength gains and hypertrophy.

<!-- metadata: section=TrainingPrinciples, level=all, goal=hypertrophy, type=theory -->
### Principle: Specificity
Training must be specific to the desired goal. The body adapts to the specific demands placed on it.

### Principle: Progressive Overload
Gradually increase stress to force adaptations. Increase weight, reps, sets, or intensity.

### Principle: Variability
Modify your routine regularly to avoid plateaus. This doesn't mean changing your routine completely, but rather making small adjustments week by week.

## Components of a Training Routine

### Component: Warm-up
Physical and mental preparation. Includes joint mobility, dynamic stretching, and approach sets.

### Component: Exercise Selection
Focused on mechanical tension, using multi-joint exercises with load progression.

### Component: Exercise Types
- Main (compound): squat, deadlift, bench press, etc.
- Accessories: isolation by muscle group.

## Structuring a Training Session

### Frequency
How many times per week to train each muscle group. Recommended: up to 3 times per group.

### Number of Exercises
Between 4-6 per session, prioritizing multi-joint exercises.

### Distribution (Splits)
Models such as Push-Pull-Legs, Full Body, Torso-Leg. Proper recovery is key.

## Intensity and Progression Techniques

### Key Terms
- RPE, RIR, 1RM, Periodization, Sets to Failure, Deload
- Techniques: AMRAP, Drop Sets, Rest-Pause, Clusters, Supersets, Jumpsets, Burns, Negatives

### Recommendations
- Use techniques strategically
- Prioritize mechanical tension over other variables

<!-- metadata: section=Recommendations, level=all, goal=hypertrophy, type=recommendation -->
## Final Recommendations

- Prioritize mechanical tension with compound exercises
- Implement constant progressive overload
- Incorporate planned variability
- Master technique in basic exercises
- Use intensity techniques sparingly
- Adjust based on progress and recovery
- Adapt based on user level
- Monitor rest, nutrition, and stress
