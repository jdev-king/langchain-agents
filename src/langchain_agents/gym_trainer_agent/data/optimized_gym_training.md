- Daily Steps: 10,000
- Water Intake: 35 ml/kg body weight
- Evening Meal: Light dinner at 6 PM
- Post-Workout Snack: Recommended

## Tracking

- Format: (Reps & Weight) x Set
- Basic Lifts: Bench Press, Military Press, Pull-up, Row, Deadlift, Squat
- Accessories: Bicep Curl, Triceps Dips
- 8RM = PR
- Techniques: Drop Set < Rest-Pause (15 sec)
- Track tempo (eccentric/concentric)
- Combine free weights + machines

## Common Terminology

- RPE: Rate of Perceived Exertion (1–10 scale)
- RIR: Reps in Reserve
- 1RM: One Rep Max
- Periodization: Planned variation of training
- Failure (Muscular vs. Technical)
- Drop Sets, Rest-Pause, Clusters, Negatives, Forced Reps
- Burns: Baby Reps
- Microcycles, Macrocycles, Training Blocks

## Periodized Training by Block

### Neural Block

| Type       | Reps     | % of Series |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Strength   | 2–5      | 50–60%      |
| Hypertrophy| 6–12     | 20–40%      |
| Pump       | 12–20+   | 0–10%       |

### Metabolic Block

| Type       | Reps     | % of Series |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Strength   | 2–5      | 10–20%      |
| Hypertrophy| 6–12     | 20–30%      |
| Pump       | 12–20+   | 40–60%      |

### Mechanical Block

| Type       | Reps     | % of Series |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Strength   | 2–5      | 20–30%      |
| Hypertrophy| 6–12     | 40–60%      |
| Pump       | 12–20+   | 10–30%      |

## Training Level Assessment

Questions to determine training level:
1. Current lifting experience
2. Familiarity with basic lifts
3. Available time to train
4. Preferred workout style
5. Volume and intensity tolerance
6. Physical limitations
7. Goal: muscle gain, fat loss, strength
8. Interference from other sports/lifestyle

### Focus by Level

- Beginner: High frequency, full-body training 3x/week
- Intermediate: Split programs, increased intensity
- Advanced: Multifrequency, intelligent volume/intensity

## Programming Rationale

Progressive Overload: Adapting to a repeated load until capable of lifting more

## Nutrition

### Caloric Needs

- Basal Metabolic Rate: 2120 kcal
- Maintenance: 3287 kcal
- Deficit: 2787 kcal

### Macro Guidelines

| Macro     | % of Calories   | Target                        |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Protein   | 10–35%           | 2g/kg (bulk) / 2.5g/kg (cut)  |
| Carbs     | 45–65%           | ~5g/kg                        |
| Fats      | 20–35%           | 0.8g/kg (bulk) / 0.5g/kg (cut)|
| Fiber     | —                | 25g/day                       |

### Notes

- If overweight, subtract 20% of bodyweight for calorie estimation
- Adjust +10% for bulking or -10% for cutting

## Scientific Limitations

- Hypertrophy is multifactorial and hard to isolate
- Most studies last 6–12 weeks with limited conclusions
- Limited evidence for long-term training superiority
- Studies often on untrained individuals
- Motor learning and form not standardized
- General improvement due to beginner gains
